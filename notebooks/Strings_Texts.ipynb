However, you can create a new string based on the original string with modifications. Strings can be defined using either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (\" \"), and they can contain letters, numbers, special characters, spaces, and even escape sequences (like \\n for a new line).\n",

    "## String Character Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding is a system that pairs a sequence of characters from a given set with something else (e.g. ordinal numbers) to enable the transmission and storage of data. In computing, we deal with different character encodings due to historical and practical reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was one of the first character encodings and is based on the English alphabet.\n",
    "- ASCII uses 7 bits to represent each character, allowing for 128 different symbols.\n",
    "- It covers English letters, digits, and a few punctuation marks, but lacks characters from non-English languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unicode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unicode is a computing industry standard designed to consistently represent text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.\n",
    "- It can represent over a million characters, covering a wide array of languages and symbols.\n",
    "- Unicode is an abstract representation. To store Unicode characters in memory or on disk, we need a specific encoding, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits):\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a variable-width character encoding that can represent any character in the Unicode standard.\n",
    "- UTF-8 is backward-compatible with ASCII.\n",
    "- It's the dominant character encoding for the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Page (Windows Encoding):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before Unicode became widespread, many different encodings were created to handle different languages and character sets. Windows had its own set of encodings known as \"code pages\".\n",
    "- Each code page supports different character sets. For instance, CP1250 is for Eastern European languages, while CP1251 is for Cyrillic script.\n",
    "- With the advent of Unicode, code pages have become less common, but you might still encounter them in legacy systems or older data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting Between Various String Encodings in Python:\n",

    "In Python, you can convert a string from one encoding to another using the *encode()* and *decode()* methods."
